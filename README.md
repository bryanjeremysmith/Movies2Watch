## Description

Sometimes you'll think of movie you would like to watch but once you have time to sit down and watch something it can be hard to remember what that movie was. This webpage will help solve that problem, simply search for the movie you would like to see, decide if it's something you would like to watch and add it your list and next time you have a movie night you'll have a list of options readily available.
